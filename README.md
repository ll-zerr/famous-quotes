# Famous Quotes

This is a modification to the [Scroll Animation project (Day 6) in the Udemy course 50 projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?src=sac&kw=50+projects+50+days).

## Project Details

The goal of the initial project was to have boxes slide in from opposite sides of the browser when the user scrolls up or down the page. I wanted to utilize this base code and build upon it in order to present the user with a visually appealling list of famous quotes. To accomplish this, I had to:

- Implement a fetch API to pull a specific type and quantity of quotes.
- Restrict the quotes to a limited number of characters.
- Utilize a for Each loop to run over the quotes array.
- Target the content and author of each quote.
- Update the text of each box to reflect the quote and author.
